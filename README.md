## Analysis of Gene Regulatory Networks from Gene Expression Using Graph Neural Networks

#### ABSTRACT

Unraveling the complexities of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Traditional computational methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of these networks. This study explores the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a powerful approach for modeling graph-structured data like GRNs. Utilizing a Graph Attention Network v2 (GATv2), our study presents a novel approach in the construction and interrogation of GRNs, informed by gene expression data and Boolean models derived from literature. The model's adeptness in accurately predicting regulatory interactions and pinpointing key regulators is attributed to advanced attention mechanisms, a hallmark of the GNN framework. These insights suggest that GNNs are primed to revolutionize GRN analysis, addressing traditional limitations and offering richer biological insights. The success of GNNs, as highlighted by our model's reliance on high-quality data, calls for enhanced data collection methods to sustain progress. The integration of GNNs in GRN research is set to pioneer developments in personalized medicine, drug discovery, and our grasp of biological systems, bolstered by the structural analysis of networks for improved node and edge prediction.
